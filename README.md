Kakuma & Kalobeyei Water Access Analysis Project
📊 A Data Analytics Capstone Project
1. Project Title

Kakuma & Kalobeyei Water Access and Sanitation Data Analysis

2. Business Problem

Humanitarian agencies in Kakuma and Kalobeyei need reliable, data-driven insights on water access, sanitation conditions, and distance to water points to improve resource allocation, planning, and monitoring.

However, available field data is scattered and not analyzed in a centralized, decision-ready format.

3. Business Understanding

Water scarcity affects:

Daily household survival

Time spent collecting water

Health and sanitation

Overall humanitarian well-being

This project provides actionable insights for NGOs, WASH partners, and decision-makers.

4. Project Objectives

✔ Clean, process, and analyze water-access data
✔ Build interactive dashboards for monitoring
✔ Identify zones with lowest access and sanitation
✔ Evaluate compliance with 20L/person/day (Sphere Standard)
✔ Provide recommendations for humanitarian planning

5. Criterion for Success

The project is considered successful if it delivers:

A clean and well-structured dataset

Insightful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clear visualizations & dashboards

A concise non-technical report

Actionable recommendations

6. Data Understanding

The dataset contains:

Feature	Description
Zone	Kakuma 1–4, Kalobeyei
Liters_Per_Person_Day	Daily water access
Distance_to_Water_Source	Walking distance (m)
Sanitation_Score	Condition of sanitation facilities
Water_Source_Type	Piped, borehole, tanker, etc.

9. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary

Key insights:

0% of households meet the 20L/person/day Sphere Standard

Kalobeyei, Kakuma 1 & Kakuma 2 have the worst sanitation scores

Distance to water sources is far above recommended levels

Boreholes are the most common but least stable sources

10. Conclusions

Water access is far below humanitarian standards

Poor sanitation correlates directly with poor water access

Zones require targeted interventions and monitoring

Dashboard visualizations support real-time decision making

11. Recommendations

✔ Increase borehole capacity
✔ Expand piped water systems
✔ Improve sanitation facilities
✔ Deploy WASH monitoring dashboards
✔ Focus on high-risk zones for urgent intervention

12. Non-Technical Summary (Simple Language)

Residents walk long distances for little water.
Most zones do not meet international standards.
Sanitation is poor where water access is low.
Dashboards help organizations plan better services.
